## About
This is the final project for Introduction to Programming (CSCI 270) at Modesto Junior College. The program "calculates" the user's personality type, western and Chinese zodiac sign, and bio-rhythm based on their date of birth. It is written in Python 3.6 and uses the [Turtle Graphics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) library for the GUI. Each time the application is run, a web browser will open and display the user's results. Additionally, user input is logged to a text file for later review and program input/output is saved to a database.

## Installation
To install and run this project locally, you will need to have [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/) with [IDLE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html) or an alternative text editor install on your machine.
